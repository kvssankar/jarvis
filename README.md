  Let AI suggest tags or add your own to keep things tidy.

* **Collections**  
  Group related screenshots for quick navigation.

* **Choose Your AI**

## How It Works + Privacy

By default, Shots Studio can send your screenshot data to **Google’s Gemini API** for cloud-powered analysis.  
For privacy-first use, switch to **Gemma on-device AI** — no data leaves your phone.

More details: [Gemini API Privacy Policy](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/terms).
