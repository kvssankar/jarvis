## Code of Conduct

This project follows a simple code of conduct: **Be respectful and constructive**. We're building something amazing together, and everyone deserves to be treated with kindness and respect.

## Getting Started

Before you start contributing, please:

1. **Check existing issues** to see if your bug report or feature request already exists
2. **Create an issue first** before starting any significant work — this helps us track progress and avoid duplicate efforts
3. **Read through this guide** to understand our development process

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Flutter SDK**: Version 3.7.2 or higher
- **Dart SDK**: Included with Flutter
- **Android Studio/VS Code**: For development and debugging
- **Git**: For version control
- **Python 3.x**: For the web component (if working on web features)

### Setting Up Your Development Environment

1. **Fork and clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/shots-studio.git
   cd shots-studio
   ```

2. **Set up Git hooks** (required for version management):

   ```bash
   git config core.hooksPath scripts/git-hooks
   ```

3. **Navigate to the Flutter app directory**:

   ```bash
   cd shots_studio
   ```

4. **Install Flutter dependencies**:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

5. **Verify your setup**:

   ```bash
   flutter doctor
   ```

6. **Run the app**:

   ```bash
   # F-Droid flavor (recommended for development)
   flutter run --flavor fdroid --dart-define=BUILD_SOURCE=fdroid

   # Or run specific flavors
   flutter run --flavor github --dart-define=BUILD_SOURCE=github
   flutter run --flavor playstore --dart-define=BUILD_SOURCE=playstore
   ```

### Build Flavors

This project supports different build flavors for different distribution sources. See [`docs/BUILD_FLAVORS.md`](docs/BUILD_FLAVORS.md) for detailed information.

**Quick Reference:**

- **F-Droid (recommended)**: `flutter run --flavor fdroid --dart-define=BUILD_SOURCE=fdroid`
- **GitHub**: `flutter run --flavor github --dart-define=BUILD_SOURCE=github`
- **Play Store**: `flutter run --flavor playstore --dart-define=BUILD_SOURCE=playstore`

The build source affects:

- Update checking behavior (enabled for GitHub, disabled for F-Droid/Play Store)
- Analytics tracking
- About section display in the app

## How to Contribute

### 🐛 Reporting Bugs

1. **Search existing issues** to avoid duplicates
2. **Create a new issue** with the "bug" label
3. **Include the following information**:
   - Device and Android version
   - App version (found in Settings)
   - Steps to reproduce the bug
   - Expected vs. actual behavior
   - Screenshots or error logs (if applicable)
   - Whether you have dev mode enabled

### 💡 Feature Requests

1. **Check existing issues** for similar requests
2. **Create a new issue** with the "enhancement" label
3. **Describe**:
   - The problem you're trying to solve
   - Your proposed solution
   - Why this would benefit other users
   - Any implementation ideas (optional)

### 🔧 Code Contributions

1. **Create or comment on an issue** describing what you want to work on
2. **Wait for assignment** — this helps us coordinate efforts and provide guidance
3. **Fork the repository** and create a feature branch
4. **Implement your changes** following our guidelines
5. **Submit a pull request** referencing the issue

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style

- **Flutter/Dart**: Follow the [official Dart style guide](https://dart.dev/guides/language/effective-dart/style)
- **Python**: Use [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/) formatter for consistent code formatting
- **Naming**: Use descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes
- **Comments**: Write clear comments for complex logic, but prefer self-documenting code

### Architecture Patterns

- **State Management**: Use Flutter's built-in state management (setState, StatefulWidget)
- **Services**: Business logic should be in service classes (`lib/services/`)
- **Models**: Data structures should be in model classes (`lib/models/`)
- **Separation of Concerns**: Keep UI, business logic, and data access separate

### Git Workflow

1. **Branch Naming**: Use descriptive names like `feature/ai-search-improvements` or `fix/screenshot-loading-issue`
2. **Commit Messages**: Write clear, concise commit messages explaining what and why
3. **Small Commits**: Make atomic commits that can be easily reviewed
4. **Rebase**: Prefer rebasing over merging for cleaner history

### Key Development Areas

- **Flutter App** (`shots_studio/`): Main mobile application
- **AI Integration**: Gemini API service integration
- **Database**: Local storage and data management
- **UI/UX**: Material Design components and user experience
- **Performance**: Memory management and background processing
- **Documentation**: User guides and API documentation

## Testing

We follow **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** principles:

### Writing Tests

1. **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions and classes

   ```bash
   flutter test test/unit/
   ```

2. **Widget Tests**: Test UI components

   ```bash
   flutter test test/widget/
   ```

3. **Integration Tests**: Test complete user flows
   ```bash
   flutter test test/integration/
   ```

### Test Requirements

- **New Features**: Must include corresponding tests
- **Bug Fixes**: Should include regression tests
- **Coverage**: Aim for meaningful test coverage, not just high percentages
- **Test Quality**: Tests should be readable, maintainable, and reliable

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
flutter test

# Run tests with coverage
flutter test --coverage

# Run specific test file
flutter test test/services/gemini_service_test.dart
```

## Submitting Changes

### Pull Request Process

3. **Include a clear description** of your changes
4. **Add screenshots** for UI changes
5. **Ensure tests pass** and add new tests as needed
6. **Update documentation** if your changes affect user-facing features

## Development Tips

### Useful Commands

```bash
# Clean build files
flutter clean && flutter pub get

# Run with verbose logging
flutter run -v

# Build APK for testing (F-Droid flavor)
flutter build apk --debug --flavor fdroid --dart-define=BUILD_SOURCE=fdroid

# Build specific flavors
flutter build apk --release --flavor fdroid --dart-define=BUILD_SOURCE=fdroid
flutter build apk --release --flavor github --dart-define=BUILD_SOURCE=github
flutter build apk --release --flavor playstore --dart-define=BUILD_SOURCE=playstore

# Use the convenience build script
chmod +x build_flavors.sh
./build_flavors.sh fdroid debug      # F-Droid debug build
./build_flavors.sh github release    # GitHub release build

# Check for dependency updates
flutter pub outdated

# Generate code (if using code generation)
flutter packages pub run build_runner build

# Run with specific device
flutter run -d <device-id>
```

### Debugging

- **Enable Dev Mode**: In app settings for additional debugging features
- **Check Logs**: Use `flutter logs` or Android Studio's logcat
- **Performance**: Use Flutter Inspector for UI debugging
- **Memory**: Monitor memory usage during AI processing

### Common Gotchas

- **API Keys**: Don't commit API keys — use environment variables or local config
- **File Paths**: Use `path_provider` for cross-platform file operations
- **Background Processing**: Test on real devices, not just emulators
- **Permissions**: Android permissions need to be declared and requested properly
